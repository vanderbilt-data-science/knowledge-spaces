# Taxonomic Frameworks for Classifying Learning Objectives and Knowledge Items

This reference consolidates the major cognitive and learning taxonomies used across the KST skill pipeline. Skills that extract knowledge items, decompose learning objectives, or map concepts should classify items against one or more of these frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage of cognitive demand levels.

## Bloom's Revised Taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001)

Bloom's Revised Taxonomy is a two-dimensional classification system. The **Cognitive Process Dimension** describes the type of thinking required, and the **Knowledge Dimension** describes the type of knowledge involved. Every learning objective or knowledge item can be located at an intersection of these two dimensions.

### Cognitive Process Dimension

| Level | Category | Definition | Representative Verbs |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Remember** | Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory | Recognize, recall, identify, list, name, define, reproduce, state, match |
| 2 | **Understand** | Construct meaning from instructional messages (oral, written, graphic) | Interpret, exemplify, classify, summarize, infer, compare, explain, paraphrase, translate |
| 3 | **Apply** | Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation | Execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, calculate, complete, illustrate, apply |
| 4 | **Analyze** | Break material into constituent parts; determine how parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose | Differentiate, organize, attribute, distinguish, compare, contrast, deconstruct, outline |
| 5 | **Evaluate** | Make judgments based on criteria and standards | Check, critique, judge, justify, argue, defend, assess, appraise, support, evaluate |
| 6 | **Create** | Put elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure | Generate, plan, produce, design, construct, devise, compose, formulate, synthesize, invent |

### Knowledge Dimension

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Factual** | Basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it — terminology, specific details, elements | Vocabulary terms, mathematical symbols, names of anatomical structures, historical dates |
| **Conceptual** | Interrelationships among basic elements within a larger structure — classifications, categories, principles, generalizations, theories, models, structures | Taxonomic classifications, Newton's laws, supply-and-demand model, Piaget's stages |
| **Procedural** | How to do something — methods of inquiry, criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, methods | Long division algorithm, laboratory protocols, statistical test selection procedure, citation formatting rules |
| **Metacognitive** | Knowledge of cognition in general and awareness of one's own cognition — strategic knowledge, knowledge about cognitive tasks, self-knowledge | Knowing that concept-mapping aids one's retention, awareness of one's tendency to rush through word problems, knowledge of when to apply which study strategy |

### The 2D Taxonomy Table

|  | Remember | Understand | Apply | Analyze | Evaluate | Create |
|--|----------|-----------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Factual** | List key terms | Summarize facts | Classify given examples | Distinguish fact from opinion | Check accuracy of statements | Compile a reference sheet |
| **Conceptual** | Recall a principle | Explain a theory | Apply a model to new data | Compare two theories | Critique a model's assumptions | Propose a new framework |
| **Procedural** | State the steps | Clarify why a step is needed | Execute a procedure | Troubleshoot a process | Judge efficiency of a method | Design a new procedure |
| **Metacognitive** | Identify a learning strategy | Explain when a strategy is useful | Use a self-monitoring checklist | Reflect on one's reasoning | Evaluate one's study plan | Create a personalized learning plan |

## Hess Cognitive Rigor Matrix (Bloom's x Webb's DOK)

The Hess Cognitive Rigor Matrix (Hess, Jones, Carlock, & Walkup, 2009) crosses the six Bloom's Revised Taxonomy cognitive process levels with Webb's four Depth of Knowledge levels to produce a more nuanced picture of cognitive demand. Each cell indicates whether the combination is typical, possible, or unlikely.

| Bloom's Level | DOK 1 — Recall & Reproduction | DOK 2 — Skill/Concept | DOK 3 — Strategic Thinking | DOK 4 — Extended Thinking |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Remember** | Recall a fact, term, definition, or simple procedure | — | — | — |
| **Understand** | Describe or explain a concept in own words; identify the main idea | Specify and explain relationships (e.g., cause-effect, non-examples vs. examples) | Explain, generalize, or connect ideas using supporting evidence | — |
| **Apply** | Follow a simple, well-known procedure; apply a formula | Select a procedure and perform it; solve a routine problem with multiple steps | Design an investigation or apply concepts to solve non-routine problems | Initiate, design, and conduct a project that requires solving a novel problem across multiple domains |
| **Analyze** | Identify components, retrieve information from a table or graph | Categorize or compare data; identify patterns | Analyze interrelationships among concepts or data sets; draw and support conclusions | Analyze multiple sources or texts; synthesize information across complex data |
| **Evaluate** | — | Identify or distinguish relevant/irrelevant information; judge credibility | Cite evidence and develop a logical argument; critique experimental design | Apply evaluation criteria to multiple data sets or across disciplines; evaluate the merit of competing approaches |
| **Create** | — | Generate conjectures or hypotheses based on observations; brainstorm | Synthesize information from multiple sources to develop a new product or generalization | Design a model that requires synthesis across disciplines; create an original work for a real-world audience |

Cells marked "—" represent combinations that are logically possible but rarely encountered in practice.

## Webb's Depth of Knowledge (Webb, 1997)

Norman Webb's DOK framework categorizes the depth of understanding required to complete a task. Unlike Bloom's (which describes cognitive process type), DOK describes the complexity and depth of thinking required.

### Level 1 — Recall and Reproduction

- **Description:** Tasks require recall of a fact, information, definition, term, or simple procedure. There is little to no transformation of knowledge.
- **Student role:** Respond, recite, identify, recall, recognize.
- **Examples:** Define *photosynthesis*. State the quadratic formula. Identify the independent variable.
- **Duration indicator:** Typically completed in seconds to a few minutes.

### Level 2 — Skill/Concept

- **Description:** Tasks require engagement of mental processing beyond recall. Students must make decisions about how to approach a problem, compare or classify, organize data, estimate, or interpret information.
- **Student role:** Classify, organize, estimate, compare, interpret, make observations, summarize.
- **Examples:** Compare two characters' motivations. Organize data in a table and describe patterns. Solve a multi-step equation. Explain the difference between mitosis and meiosis.
- **Duration indicator:** Minutes to a class period.

### Level 3 — Strategic Thinking

- **Description:** Tasks require reasoning, planning, developing evidence, explaining thinking, and making conjectures. Cognitive demands are complex and abstract. Often there is more than one possible approach or answer.
- **Student role:** Develop a logical argument, plan an investigation, cite evidence, draw conclusions, explain phenomena.
- **Examples:** Design an experiment to test a hypothesis. Justify your solution method. Analyze a primary source and draw conclusions about the author's intent. Compare approaches to solving a system of equations and defend the most efficient method.
- **Duration indicator:** Extended class time; may span multiple sessions.

### Level 4 — Extended Thinking

- **Description:** Tasks require an extended period of time for investigation, complex reasoning, planning, developing, and thinking. Students must synthesize information from multiple sources, apply concepts across domains, and often produce an original product.
- **Student role:** Design, connect, synthesize, apply across domains, critique, create.
- **Examples:** Conduct an independent research project. Design and build a working model with a written rationale. Develop and test a mathematical model for a real-world system. Write and defend a thesis.
- **Duration indicator:** Days to weeks.

## SOLO Taxonomy (Biggs & Collis, 1982)

The Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy classifies student responses by structural complexity. It is particularly useful for evaluating the sophistication of a student's understanding rather than merely whether an answer is correct.

| Level | Name | Description | Indicators |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Pre-structural** | The response shows no understanding of the relevant concepts. Information is unorganized, irrelevant, or contradictory. | Misses the point entirely; provides irrelevant information; may use tautology or circular reasoning. |
| 2 | **Uni-structural** | The response focuses on one relevant aspect of the task. A single correct element is identified, but the broader picture is missing. | Identifies one component; gives a single-factor explanation; can name or identify but not relate. |
| 3 | **Multi-structural** | Several relevant aspects are identified, but they are treated independently — not integrated into a coherent whole. | Lists multiple factors; provides enumeration without synthesis; "and...and...and..." structure. |
| 4 | **Relational** | The relevant aspects are integrated into a coherent structure. The student shows understanding of relationships, causes, and effects within the given context. | Compares, contrasts, explains causes, integrates parts into a whole; applies within the given context; coherent argument or explanation. |
| 5 | **Extended Abstract** | The coherent structure is generalized to a higher level of abstraction. The student hypothesizes, theorizes, or transfers understanding to new domains. | Generalizes beyond the given context; generates new hypotheses; reflects on own understanding; connects to broader theory or different domains. |

### Mapping SOLO to Bloom's (approximate)

- Pre-structural: below Remember
- Uni-structural: Remember
- Multi-structural: Understand / Apply
- Relational: Analyze / Evaluate
- Extended Abstract: Evaluate / Create

## Marzano's New Taxonomy (Marzano & Kendall, 2007)

Marzano and Kendall's taxonomy is organized into three systems and a knowledge domain. Each system contains levels that operate on the knowledge domain.

### Three Systems of Thinking

#### 1. Self System (Level 6)

The Self System determines whether and how a learner engages with a new task. It encompasses:
- **Examining importance:** Does the learner see the task as valuable?
- **Examining efficacy:** Does the learner believe they can succeed?
- **Examining emotional response:** What affective reactions does the task trigger?
- **Examining motivation:** Is the learner willing to invest effort?

This system acts as a gatekeeper: if the self-system does not engage, the other systems may not activate.

#### 2. Metacognitive System (Level 5)

The Metacognitive System monitors and regulates cognitive processes:
- **Specifying goals:** Setting clear learning targets.
- **Process monitoring:** Tracking one's progress toward a goal.
- **Monitoring clarity:** Assessing whether one's understanding is precise.
- **Monitoring accuracy:** Checking whether one's conclusions are correct.

#### 3. Cognitive System (Levels 1–4)

The Cognitive System contains four hierarchical levels:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 4 | **Knowledge Utilization** | Using knowledge to accomplish a specific task — decision making, problem solving, experimental inquiry, investigation |
| 3 | **Analysis** | Extending knowledge beyond what was taught — matching, classifying, analyzing errors, generalizing, specifying |
| 2 | **Comprehension** | Identifying the critical features of knowledge — integrating (summarizing, representing), symbolizing (creating mental images, analogies) |
| 1 | **Retrieval** | Activating and transferring knowledge from permanent memory — recognizing, recalling, executing |

### Knowledge Domain

The knowledge that the three systems operate on:
- **Information:** Organizing ideas, details, vocabulary terms, facts, time sequences, cause-effect sequences, episodes
- **Mental Procedures:** Single rules, algorithms, tactics, macro-procedures
- **Psychomotor Procedures:** Foundational procedures, complex combination procedures

## Fink's Taxonomy of Significant Learning (Fink, 2003)

Fink's taxonomy is non-hierarchical and interactive — the categories are not ordered by complexity, and significant learning experiences often involve multiple categories simultaneously. This makes it particularly useful for designing holistic learning experiences.

### The Six Categories

#### 1. Foundational Knowledge

- **Description:** Understanding and remembering specific information and ideas. This provides the basic understanding necessary for other kinds of learning.
- **Guiding questions:** What key information (facts, terms, formulae, concepts, principles, relationships) is important for students to understand and remember?
- **KST relevance:** Maps directly to factual and conceptual knowledge items.

#### 2. Application

- **Description:** Using knowledge to engage in various kinds of thinking (critical, creative, practical) and to develop skills (intellectual, physical, social) and manage complex projects.
- **Guiding questions:** What kinds of thinking (critical, creative, practical) are important for students to learn? What important skills do students need to develop? Do students need to learn how to manage complex projects?
- **KST relevance:** Maps to procedural items; often appears in higher DOK levels.

#### 3. Integration

- **Description:** Making connections among ideas, subjects, and people. Students see and understand the connections between different things.
- **Guiding questions:** What connections should students be able to make among ideas within this course? Between this course and other courses? Between this course and the wider world?
- **KST relevance:** Reflects the relational structure — items that bridge sub-domains in the knowledge graph.

#### 4. Human Dimension

- **Description:** Learning about oneself and about others. Students discover the personal and social implications of what they have learned.
- **Guiding questions:** What can or should students learn about themselves? What can or should students learn about understanding or interacting with others?
- **KST relevance:** Often captured as metacognitive or affective items, particularly in professional training domains.

#### 5. Caring

- **Description:** Developing new feelings, interests, and values. Students care about the subject matter and are motivated to learn more.
- **Guiding questions:** What changes in students' feelings, interests, or values would you like to foster? What would you like students to care about as a result of this course?
- **KST relevance:** Aligns with Marzano's Self System; may influence the self-system gating of engagement.

#### 6. Learning How to Learn

- **Description:** Becoming a better student, learning how to engage in a particular kind of inquiry (scientific, historical, etc.), and becoming a self-directed learner.
- **Guiding questions:** What would you like students to learn about how to be a good student in a course like this? How to learn about the subject on their own? How to become a self-directed learner?
- **KST relevance:** Maps to metacognitive items and supports long-term adaptive learning.

### Interactive Nature

Unlike hierarchical taxonomies, Fink's categories are synergistic: achieving one kind of learning enhances the potential for achieving the others. For example, when students develop **caring** about a topic, their **foundational knowledge** acquisition improves. When they engage in **integration**, their capacity for **application** deepens.

## Choosing a Framework

| Framework | Best Used For | Key Strength |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Bloom's Revised** | Classifying individual items by cognitive process and knowledge type | Universal, widely understood, two-dimensional |
| **Hess CRM** | Calibrating assessment items for both cognitive level and depth | Fine-grained demand calibration |
| **Webb's DOK** | Ensuring assessments span a range of cognitive depths | Focus on complexity/depth rather than process type |
| **SOLO** | Evaluating quality of student responses | Structural complexity of understanding |
| **Marzano's** | Incorporating metacognitive and motivational dimensions | Three-system architecture beyond cognition |
| **Fink's** | Designing holistic learning experiences | Non-hierarchical, synergistic categories |

For KST item extraction and decomposition, a recommended approach is:
1. Use **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy** as the primary classifier (cognitive process + knowledge type).
2. Cross-reference with **Webb's DOK** to verify depth of knowledge requirements.
3. Use the **Hess CRM** to validate that the item sits at the intended intersection.
4. Apply **Fink's** categories to ensure coverage of non-cognitive dimensions where relevant.
5. Use **SOLO** when evaluating student responses to constructed-response items.
